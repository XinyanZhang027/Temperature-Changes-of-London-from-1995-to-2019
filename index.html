		<h1>Temperature Changes of London from 1995 to 2019</h1>
		<div>
			<p class="intro">
				The data source is from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities" target="view_window">Kaggle</a>, which records the daily temperatures (°F) 
						of the major cities worldwide from 1995 to 2019. The data visualisations were made by <a href="https://pyecharts.org/#/en-us/" target="view_window">Pyecharts</a>.
			</p>

			<p class="intro">
				This report focuses on the temperature changes of London and is intended to find out the 
				trend and regulation of them.
			</p>
			<p class="intro">
				<h2>1.Data Analysis</h2> 
				<p class="intro">
					The data set record the daily temperatures of 321 cities among 125 countries from 1995 to 2019.
					However, there are 79672 missing data which is recorded as '-99'. I fill them using the mean data.
				</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>2. Data Visulasations</h2> 
				<h3>2.1 Calendar Heatmaps of the daily temperatures</h3>
				<p class="intro">
				The following calendar heatmaps are created based on the daily temperatures of London 
				from 1995 to 2019. We can change the year by clicking the tabs on the top of the calendar 
				heatmaps. By moving the mouse to the date, we can see the certain temperature of that day.
				</p>
				<p class="intro">
				Through the calendars, we can find the temperature distribution of every year and see the temperature trend of London.
				<p class="intro">
				
				In the years 2003, 2010, 2013, there were more low-temperature days than other years. 
				On the contrary, in the years 1998, 2002, 2007, 2011, and after 2014, there were fewer 
				low-temperature days, and the climate was warmer. Therefore, we can find that the hot 
				year and the cold year appeared about every four years. But after 2014, the cold years 
				became fewer, and the days with low temperatures were much less than the days with high 
				temperatures. In other words, the temperatures of London become higher. For example, 
				in 2010, there were 52 days with temperatures under 36℉ and 25 days with temperatures over 
				84 ℉. However, in 2019, there were eight days with temperatures under 36 ℉.

			<h3>2.2 Line charts of Monthly Highest and Lowest Temperatures</h3>
			<p class="intro">
				The Line Chart with Timelines shows the monthly highest and lowest 
				temperatures of London from 1995 to 2019. A timeline bar at the bottom 
				can be clicked or dragged to display the temperatures in different years. 
				Audiences can play the charts automatically.
			</p>
			<p class="intro">
				There are two dotted lines in the chart. The yellow line represents the 
				average of the highest monthly temperatures for the year. The blue line 
				represents the average of the lowest monthly temperatures for the year. 
				Four teardrop-shaped dots represent the maximum and minimum values of each line.
			</p>
			<p class="intro">
				By dragging the timeline bar, we can see that:
				 <ul class="intro">
					 <li>The highest temperature usually appeared in June, July, and August. 
					 And the lowest temperature usually appeared in January, February, November, and December.</li>
					  <li>
						  The lowest temperature was 24.6℉, which appeared in 2018, and the highest temperature was 83.4℉, 
						  which appeared in 2019.
					  </li>
					  <li>
						  Although the whole weather became warmer these years, the temperature differences became more significant, too.
					  </li>
					  <li>
						  There may be more hotter and colder days in the future years.
					  </li>
				</ul>

			<h2>3. Visualisation Evaluation</h2>
			<h3>3.1 Evaluation</h3>
			<p class="intro">
				I used two different types of visualisations to show the temperature changes in London. 
				The calendar heatmap focuses on the distribution and the temperatures of each day. 
				The line charts focus on the differences between the months and years.
			</p>
			<p class="intro">
				The calendar heatmaps perform well so that audiences can quickly and directly 
				know the temperature distributions between months and years. And they can easily 
				find the temperature of a particular day.
			</p>
			<p class="intro">
				However, the line charts do not show the significant differences of years. 
				It seems that the monthly and yearly highest and lowest temperatures do not 
				vary significantly. By seeing the line charts, audiences know that the temperatures 
				 of London do not change rapidly, and the hottest and coldest months are always the 
				 certain ones, which everyone knows.
			</p>
			<h3>3.2 Improvements</h3>
			<p class="intro">
				To improve the shortcomings, I can make many efforts. 
				<ul class="intro">
				<li> Find more data sets to add to the data. The period of the data is not long, 
				just 25 years, and there are many missing data in it. It can hardly show the climate 
				changes of the world or a region. I should find more temperature data sets to make 
				it more convincing. Furthermore, I can create the visualisations of global temperature 
				changes and do some analysis.</li>
				<li>Link this data set to other data sets to find out the factors affecting temperatures.</li>
				<li>Combine different visualisations using the same control panel, which can better show 
				the changes with Timelines to the audiences.</li>
				</ul>
